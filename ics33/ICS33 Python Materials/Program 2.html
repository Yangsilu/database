This programming assignment is designed first to ensure that you know how to
  write a simple (numeric) class that overloads many of the standard Python
  operators by defining various double-underscore methods.
It also ensures that you know how to write a class that implements iterators,
  by defining both the <b>__iter__</b> and <b>__next__</b> methods.
Finally it ensure that you know how to write iterator decorators by using
  special generators (similar to functions, but using <b>yield</b> instead of
  <b>return</b>) in a module.
<p>
There are three separate parts to this assignment.
In the first part you will write a module defining a single, large numeric
  class that overloads many operators (including those performing arithmetic
  and relational comparisons).
In the second part you will write a medium-size class, which defines various
  methods, including some double-underscore methods and specifically the
  iterator protocol methods (<b>__iter__</b> and <b>__next__</b>).
In the third part you will write a module that defines various iterator
  decorators implemented by generators: each iterator decorator has argument(s)
  that are iterators and is itself used an iterator.
</p><p>
You should download the 
  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Epattis/ICS-33/assignments/program2/program2.zip">program2</a> project folder and unzip it to produce
  an Eclipse project with three modules.
You will write classes in the first two modules, which can be tested in the
  standard driver using the batch self-check files I supplied; you will write
  generators in the third module, which are tested by a special
  <b>generatordriver.py</b> module included in this project.
Eventually you will submit each of the three modules you write separately to
  Checkmate.
</p><p>
It is recommend that you work on this assignment in pairs, with someone in your
  lab section.
Try to find someone who lives near you, with similar programming skills,
  and work habits/schedule: e.g., talk about whether you prefer to work
  mornings, nights, or weekends; what kind of commitment you will make to submit
  program early.
<!---
If you believe that it is impossible for you to work with someone, because of
  some special reason(s), you should send me email stating them and asking for
  special permission to work alone (which I do grant, but not frequently).
--->
</p><p>
<b>Only one student should submit all parts of the the assignment</b>, but both
  student's names should appear in the comments at the top of
  <b>each submitted .py</b> file.
It should look something like
</p><pre><b>
# Romeo Montague, Lab 1
# Juliet Capulet, Lab 1
# We certify that we worked cooperatively on this programming
#   assignment, according to the rules for pair programming</b></pre>
If you do not know what the terms <b>cooperatively</b> and/or
  <b>rules for pair programming</b> mean, please read about
  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Epattis/common/handouts/pairprogramming.html">Pair Programming</a> 
  before starting this assignment.
Please turn in each program <b>as you finish it</b>, so that I can accurately
  assess the progress of the class as a whole during this assignment.
<p>
Print this document and carefully read it, marking any parts that contain
  important detailed information that you find (for review before you turn in
  the files).
The code you write should be as compact and elegant as possible, using 
  appropriate Python idioms.

<td width="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
Write a class that represents and defines operators for <b>Dimensional</b>
  numbers, which are represented by an <b>int</b> or <b>float</b> value
  and 3 integers representing the dimensions: length, mass, and time.
With this class we can write scripts that perform numeric calculations on
   values of this new numeric type, which automatically keeps track of the
   dimensions for each value (and prohibits operations that mix dimensions in
   illegal ways).
<p>
For example, to represent the standard acceleration due to gravity at the
  Earth's surface we might write <b>g = Dimensional(9.8,l=1,t=-2)</b> which
  represents <b>9.8 l/t**2</b>: the dimensions are length per time squared
  (where the unstated <b>length</b> unit is is meters and the unstated
  <b>time</b> unit is seconds: so this really represents <b>9.8 m/s**2</b>).
Each of the three integers represents the power of that dimension, with 
  positive powers in the numerator and negative powers in the denominator.
There are two important rules for operating on <b>Dimensional</b> values.
</p><ol>
<li>Whenever we add, subtract or relationally compare <b>Dimensional</b> values,
      the dimensions of the operands must be identical: e.g., we cannot add 10
      meters to 10 seconds and get a meaningful result, and trying to do so
      should raise the <b>DimensionError</b> (whose definition is supplied in
      the <b>dimensional.py</b> module).
<p>
</p></li><li>Whenever we multiply, divide, or raise to a power <b>Dimensional</b>
     values, the result must have the correct dimensions: e.g., multiplying
     <b>9.8 l/t**2</b> by <b>10 t</b> produces the result <b>98.0 l/t</b>: the
     value is <b>9.8 * 10 = 98.0</b> and the dimensions are
     <b>l/t**2 * t = lt/t**2 = l/t</b>.
    For multiplication, as an example, the dimensions are added:
       <b>9.8(l=1,m=0,t=-2) * 10(l=0,m=0,t=1) = 98.0(l=1,m=0,t=-1)</b> where
       the resulting dimensions are <b>l = 1+0 = 1</b>, <b>m = 0+0 = 0</b>,
       and <b>t = -2+1 = -1</b>.
</li></ol>
<h3>Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Define a class named <b>Dimensional</b> in a module named
      <b>dimensional.py</b>
<p>
</p></li><li>Define an <b>__init__</b> method that has one required parameter, and
       optional parameter names in the order <b>l, m, t</b> (whose arguments
       should be <b>int</b> and whose default values are <b>0</b>).
    This method should raise <b>AssertionError</b>(s) if any argument matching
     one of the optional parameters is not a <b>int</b>.
    <p>
    Objects in the <b>Dimensional</b> class are immutable: the methods you will
       write should never bind any instance name (except  <b>__init__</b>,
       which initializes them) but exclusively returns newly constructed
       <b>Dimensional</b> objects with the correct values and dimensions.
    I suggest using the instance names <b>l</b>, <b>m</b>, and <b>t</b> (which
       mirror the parameter names).
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Define a <b>__repr__</b> method that returns a string, which when passed to
         <b>eval</b> returns a newly constructed rational with the same value
         (<b>==</b>) to the object <b>__repr__</b> was called on.
    As an additiona requirement for <b>__repr__</b>, include named parameters
      initialized by only non-0 values: <b>__repr__(Dimensional(9.8,1,0,-2))</b>
      should return <b>'Dimensional(9.8,l=1,t=-2)'</b>
<p>
</p></li><li>Define a <b>__str__</b> method that returns a string, with the value
      followed by a triple of dimensions (in the order <b>l, m, t</b>),
      including those that are <b>0</b>: so calling
      <b>__str__(Dimensional(9.8,1,0,-2))</b> should return
      <b>'9.8(1,0,-2)'</b>.
<p>
</p></li><li>Define a <b>__getitem__</b> method that that returns the value,
      length dimension, mass dimension, time dimension, or a tuple of all three
      dimensions for the string parameters <b>'value'</b>, <b>'l'</b>,
      <b>'m'</b>, <b>'t'</b>, and <b>'d'</b> respectively.
    If any other argument value is used as a key, raise <b>KeyError</b>.
<p>
Hint: I frequently wrote code that made use of the following two facts:
</p><ul>
<li><b>g['d']</b> returns a tuple of the length, mass, and time dimensions
       (in that order).
</li><li>If <b>g['d']</b> returns <b>(1,0,-2)</b> then the call
       <b>Dimension(9.8,*g['d'])</b> is equivalent to the call
       <b>Dimension(9.8,1,0,-2)</b>.
    That is, <b>*</b> applied to a tuple in a function/method call expands the
       tuple's value into different argument positions.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>Define a method names <b>format</b> that takes s length-3 string as an
      argument; it represents one-character abbreviations of the units for the
      dimensions: <b>'mgs'</b> represents <b>m</b>eter for length, <b>g</b>ram
        for mass, and <b>s</b>econd for time.
    It returns a string with the value of the <b>Dimensional</b> followed by
      a space and its units (if the dimensions are all <b>0</b> there is no
      space), such that
      (a) each unit appears as <b>unit**power</b> although <b>**power</b> is
          implicit with a <b>power</b> of 1.
      (b) if there are negative powers, there is a <b>/</b> followed by
            the negative powers (which appear in absolute value form);
          if there are no negative powers, there is no <b>/</b>.
      (c) if there are no positive powers, and there are negative powers,  there
            is a <b>1</b> for the positive powers in the numerator.
    For example, <b>g.format('mgs')</b> returns <b>9.8 m/s**2</b>.
    See the batch-self-check file for more examples.
<p>
</p></li><li>Define all the underscore methods needed to ensure the prefix +/- work
      correctly: <b>+</b> returns the same value and dimensions, while <b>-</b>
      returns the negated value with the same dimensions.
<p> 
</p></li><li>Define all the underscore methods needed to ensure that the add, subtract,
      multiply, and divide (/) operators produce the correct answers when their
      operands are any combination of <b>Dimensional</b> and either
      <b>int</b> or <b>float</b> values.
    If Python tries to apply an +/- operator to two <b>Dimensional</b>
      values with different dimensions, or to an <b>int</b>/<b>float</b> value
      and a <b>Dimensional</b> value with any non-<b>0</b> dimensions, raise a
      <b>DimensionError</b> indicating the mismatched dimensions.
    See the <b>Problem Summary</b> section for more details.
    If Python tries to apply an arithmetic operator to a <b>Dimensional</b>
      and any other type of value (besides <b>Dimensional</b> or <b>int</b> or
      <b>float</b>) raise the standard <b>TypeError</b> exception with the
      standard messsage about unsupported operand types: see what <b>1+'a'</b>
      produces.
    <p>
    Hint: (a) I wrote two methods to check for correct types and dimensions (one
      used in the add/subtract methods and one used in the multiply/divide
      methods); each raises the appropriate exception for any violation.
    (b) I wrote two methods that return the value/dimensions for their argument
      whose result depends on whether the argument is of type
      <b>int</b>/<b>float</b> or <b>Dimensional</b>.
    These four methods simplified all my arithmetic methods (which typically
      included just two statements: one to check the arguments; one to return
      the result (if no exceptions were raised when the arguments were checked).
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Define the underscore method that allows us to raise a <b>Dimensional</b>
      to any positive or negative <b>int</b> power or to any
      <b>Dimensional</b> power whose dimensions are all <b>0</b>.
    Determine both the resulting value and resulting dimensions: the original
      dimensions multiplied by the power.
<p>
</p></li><li>Define all the underscore methods needed to ensure that we can compare two
       <b>Dimensional</b> values with the six standard relational operators,
       with any combination of <b>Dimensional</b> and <b>int</b>/<b>float</b>.
    Regardless of its dimensions, <b>Dimensional</b> values compare with any
       <b>int</b>/<b>float</b> values; but if Python tries to compare two
       <b>Dimensional</b> values with different dimensions, raise
       <b>DimensionError</b> (as with addition and subtraction)
    Note that these rules are a bit different than for +/-, because for +/-
      <b>int</b>/<b>float</b> would work only with <b>Dimensional</b> values
      that had all dimensions <b>0</b>.
<p>
</p></li><li>Python automatically provides meanings for <b>+=</b>, <b>-=</b>, 
      <b>*=</b>, <b>/=</b>, and <b>**=</b>; ensure they are correct or define
      the needed underscore methods.
<p>
</p></li><li>Ensure that
<ul>
<li>The <b>abs</b> function works on <b>Dimensional</b> values
      (the dimensions don't change).
</li><li>Non-<b>0</b> <b>Dimensional</b> values are interpreted as <b>True</b>.
</li></ul>
<p>


</p><h3>Testing</h3>
The <b>dimensional.py</b> module includes a script that calls
  <b>driver.driver()</b>.
The project folder contains a <b>bsc1.txt</b> file (examine it) to use for
   batch-self-checking your class.
These are rigorous but not exhaustive tests.
Incrementally write and test your class: for example, getting one arithmetic
  operator working correctly will create a pattern for the others.
<p>
Note that when exceptions are raised, they are printed by the driver but the 
  <b>Command:</b> prompt sometimes appears misplaced.
</p><p>
You can write other code at the bottom of your <b>dimensional.py</b>
  module to test the <b>Dimensional</b> class, or type code into the driver
  as illustrated below.
Notice the default for each command is the command previously entered.
<b></b></p><pre><b>  Driver started

<td width="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
Write a class that represents and defines methods, operators, and iterators
  for a <b>Bag</b> class.
Bags are similar to sets, and have similar operations (of which we will
  implement just the most important) but they can store multiple copies of
  items.
Fundamentally, we will store bags as dictionaries (use <b>defaultdict</b>)
   whose elements are keys and whose values are the number of times the key
   occurs in the bag.
<b>You must store Bags using this data type as specified</b>
<h3>Details</h3>
<ul>
<li>Define a class named <b>Bag</b> in a module named <b>bag.py</b>
<p>
</p></li><li>Define an <b>__init__</b> method that has one parameter, an iterable of
       values that initalize the bag.
    Writing <b>Bag()</b> constructs an empty bag.
    Writing <b>Bag(['d','a','b','d','c','b','d'])</b> construct a bag with
      one <b>'a'</b>, two <b>'b'</b>s, one <b>'c'</b>, and three <b>'d'</b>s.
<p>
</p></li><li>Define a <b>__repr__</b> method that returns a string, which when passed to
       <b>eval</b> returns a newly constructed bag with the same value
       (<b>==</b>) to the object <b>__repr__</b> was called on.
    For example, for the <b>Bag</b> in the discussion of <b>__init__</b> the
        <b>__repr__</b> method would print its result as
       <b>Bag(['a', 'c', 'b', 'b', 'd', 'd', 'd'])</b>.
    Bags like sets are not sorted, so these 7 values can appear in any order.
    We might require that information in the list is sorted, but not all values
      we might put in a bag may be ordered (and therefore not sortable).
<p>
</p></li><li>Define a <b>__str__</b> method that returns a string that more compactly
      shows a bag.
    For example, for the <b>Bag</b> in the discussion of <b>__init__</b> the
        <b>__str__</b> method would print its result as
       <b>Bag(a[1], c[1], b[2], d[3])</b>.
    Bags like sets are not sorted, so these 7 values can appear in any order.
<p>
</p></li><li>Define a <b>__len__</b> method that returns the total number of values in
      the <b>Bag</b>.
    For example, for the <b>Bag</b> in the discussion of <b>__init__</b> the
        <b>__len__</b> method would return <b>7</b>.
<p>
</p></li><li>Define a <b>unique</b> method that returns the number of different (unique)
       values in the <b>Bag</b>.
    For example, for the <b>Bag</b> in the discussion of <b>__init__</b> the
        <b>unique</b> method would return <b>4</b>, because there are four
        different values in the <b>Bag</b>; contrast this method with
        <b>__len__</b>.
<p>      
</p></li><li>Define a <b>__contains__</b> method that returns whether or not its
      argument is in the <b>Bag</b> (one or more times).
<p>
</p></li><li>Define a <b>count</b> method that returns the number of times its argument
      is in the <b>Bag</b>: <b>0</b> if the argument is not in the <b>Bag</b>.
<p>
</p></li><li>Define an <b>add</b> method that adds its argument to the <b>Bag</b>: if
      that value is already in the <b>Bag</b>, its count is incremented by
      <b>1</b>; if it is not already in the <b>Bag</b>, it is added to the
      <b>Bag</b> with a count of <b>1</b>.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>remove</b> removes its argument from the <b>Bag</b>: if that value is
        already in the <b>Bag</b>, its count is decremented by <b>1</b> (and if
        the count reduces to <b>0</b> it is removed from the <b>dict</b>; if it
        is not in the <b>Bag</b>, raise a <b>ValueError</b> exception, with an
        appropriate message that includes the value that could not be removed.
<p>
</p></li><li>Define <b>__eq__</b>/<b>__ne__</b> methods that return whether one
      <b>Bag</b> is equal/not equal to another: contains the same values the
      same number of times.
    Comparing a <b>Bag</b> for equality to a non-<b>Bag</b> should raise a
       <b>TypeError</b>.
    Be careful and ensure that this method does not change either <b>Bag</b>.
<p>
</p></li><li>Define an <b>__iter__</b> method that that returns an object on which
      <b>next</b> can be called to produce every value in the <b>Bag</b>: all
      <b>len</b> of them.
    For example, for the <b>Bag</b> in the discussion of <b>__init__</b>, 
      the following code
<b><pre>  for i in x:
      print(i,end='')</pre></b>
would print
<b><pre>  acbbddd</pre></b>
    Bags like sets are not sorted, so these 7 values can appear in any order.
<p>
Ensure that the iterator produces those values in the <b>Bag</b> at the time
      the iterator starts executing; so mutating the <b>Bag</b> during
      iteration will <b>not</b> affect what values it produces.
</p><p>
   Hint: I defined a generator as a class method to do this job.
</p></li></ul>
I have shown only examples of <b>Bag</b>s storing strings, because they are
  convenient to write.
But bags can store any type of data.
The <b>__repr__</b>, <b>__str__</b>, and <b>__iter__/__next__</b> methods must
  be written independently: neither should call the other to get things done.
<p>
</p><h3>Testing</h3>
The <b>bag.py</b> module includes a script that calls <b>driver.driver()</b>.
The project folder contains a <b>bsc2.txt</b> file (examine it) to use for
   batch-self-checking your class.
These are rigorous but not exhaustive tests.
Incrementally write and test your class; check each method as you write it.
<p>
Note that when exceptions are raised, they are printed by the driver but the 
  <b>Command:</b> prompt sometimes appears misplaced.
</p><p>
You can write other code at the bottom of your <b>bag.py</b> module to test the
  <b>Bag</b> class, or type code into the driver as illustrated below.

<td width="80%">
<h3>Problem Summary:</h3>
Write the following iterator decorators (iterators that operate on iterators)
  using Python generators.
Write each function to be self contained, not calling any other functions or
  generators and do not use  <b>itertools.py</b> module (or any other module
  that would trivialize this code); you may also not call the <b>zip</b>
  function.
<ul>
<li><b>transform</b> takes any iterable and any function whose domain includes
      all the iterated values: it produces transformed (by the function)
      values. For example
<b><pre>  for i in transform('abCdeFg',str.upper):
      print(i,end='')</pre></b>
   produces the values <b>'A'</b>, <b>'B'</b>, <b>'C'</b>, <b>'D'</b>,
     <b>'E'</b>, <b>'F'</b>, and <b>'G'</b>.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>running_count</b> takes any iterable and any predicate function
      (taking one argument and returning a <b>bool</b> value): it produces a
      running count of how many values up to (and including) the one just
      iterated over, satisfied the predicate. For example
<b><pre>  for i in count('bananastand', lambda x : x in 'aeiou'): # is vowel
    print(i,end=' ')</pre></b>
   produces the values <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>2</b>,
      <b>3</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>4</b>.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>n_with_pad</b> takes any iterable, an int <b>n</b> and a <b>pad</b> 
      (whose default value is <b>None</b>): it produces the first <b>n</b>
      values from the iterable, padded by <b>pad</b> if there are fewer than
     <b>n</b> values in the iterable.
<b><pre>  for i n_with_pad('abcdefg',3):
    print(i,end=' ')</pre></b>
   produces the values <b>'a'</b>, <b>'b'</b> and <b>'c'</b>
<b><pre>  for i n_with_pad('abcdefg',10,'?'):
    print(i,end=' ')</pre></b>
   produces the values <b>'a'</b>, <b>'b'</b>, <b>'c'</b>, <b>'d'</b>,
   <b>'e'</b>, <b>'f'</b>, <b>'g'</b>, <b>'?'</b>, <b>'?'</b> and <b>'?'</b>.
   Hint: use a <b>for</b> loop with a <b>try/catch</b> and explicit calls to
   <b>iter</b> and <b>next</b>.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>sequence</b> takes any number of iterables as parameters: it produces
     all the values in the first iterable, followed by all in the second, ... ,
     all values in the last iterable. For example
<b><pre>  for i in sequence('abcd','ef','ghij'):
      print(i,end='')</pre></b>
     produces the values <b>'a'</b>, <b>'b'</b>, <b>'c'</b>, <b>'d'</b>,
     <b>'e'</b>, <b>'f'</b>, <b>'g'</b>, <b>'h'</b>, <b>'i'</b>, and <b>'j'</b>,
     <b>'k'</b>.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>alternate</b> takes any number of iterables as parameters: it produces
     the first value from the first parameter, then the first value from the
     the second parameter, ..., then the first value from the last parameter;
     then the second value from the first parameter, then the second value from
     the the second parameter, ..., then the second value from the last
     parameter; etc. If an iteratable produces no more values, it disappears
     from the alternation, and the process continues until there are no more
     iterables left.
<b><pre>  for i in sequence('abcde','fg','hijk'):
      print(i,end='')</pre></b>
     produces the values <b>'a'</b>, <b>'f'</b>, <b>'h'</b>, <b>'b'</b>,
     <b>'g'</b>, <b>'i'</b>, <b>'c'</b>, <b>'j'</b>, <b>'d'</b>, <b>k</b>, and
     <b>'e'</b>.
   Hint: use a <b>for</b> loop nested in <b>while</b> loop with a
     <b>try/catch</b> and explicit calls to <b>iter</b> and <b>next</b>, along
     with a list of still active iteratables.
<p>
</p></li><li><b>Extra credit</b>:
  <ul>
    <li>Write a method name <b>flatten</b> that returns every value nested in
          any iterable data type (except for string: return strings as
          themselves, not their individual characters.
        When iterating through a dictionary, iterated through just its keys.
        For example
<b><pre>  for i in flatten([1,2,[3,4,(5,6,7,{'abc':1,'xyz':2}),8,9],10]):
    print(i,end=' ')</pre></b>
    Prints as: <b>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 xyz abc 8 9 10</b>
    <p>
    Note that this iterator does not control the order that <b>sets</b> or keys
       of <b>dicts</b> are iterated through (we could if we used <b>sorted</b>),
        although iteration through lists and tuples is always sequential.
    Hint: use iteration and recursion and one use of <b>type</b> to check for
      strings.
</p></li></ul>
<h3>Testing</h3>
The <b>generator.py</b> module includes a script that calls
  <b>driver.driver()</b>.
The project folder contains a <b>bsc3.txt</b> file (examine it) to use for
   batch-self-checking your class.
These are rigorous but not exhaustive tests.
Incrementally write and test your class; check each function as you write it.
<p>
I have also provided the <b>generatordriver.py</b> module, which has the same
  tests as <b>bsc3.txt</b> but in a form more amenable for debugging these
  generators.
